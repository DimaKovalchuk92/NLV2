# Project: New Life Vision OS
# Methodology: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

## Core Documents
- **Main Specs**: Refer to `TZ_v3.docx` for full vision.
- **MVP Scope**: Refer to `MVP_Scope_Document.docx`. ONLY implement Phase 1 features.
- **Development Process**: Follow `AI_Dev_Plan_v2_SDD.docx`. 

## Rules for AI Assistant
1. NEVER code a feature without an Epic folder in `docs/epics/`.
2. Every Epic must have: `specification.md`, `non-goals.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`.
3. Strict Phase 1 focus: Ignore Insurance Billing and AI Analytics for now (as per MVP Scope).
4. Use Tailwind CSS and MockAPI for the current stage.
